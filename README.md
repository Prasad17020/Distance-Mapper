# Distance-Mapper
Concept: - Mapping distance like RADAR requires a rotating sensor that picks up distance at different level and maps into 2D view. Just like RADAR, to rotate UltraSonic Distance sensor, we need a servo that accurately rotates it.
		We can get the view in 2D by using the processing app which will perceive the data from the Ultrasonic Sensor(HC-SR04) and then convert it into a 2D view.	These sensor measures the distance in the visible sight.
